# Pneumonia Detection Using CNNs on Chest X-ray Images
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The dataset used in this project is the Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset, sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset
Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). <br>
The dataset consists of 5,863 labeled X-ray images, divided into two categories:

> - Normal: X-ray images of healthy lungs. <br>
> - Pneumonia: X-ray images of lungs showing signs of pneumonia. <br>

## Project Overview
The notebook implements a CNN model designed to accurately distinguish between normal and pneumonia-affected X-rays. The project involves:

## Preprocessing the X-ray images.
Building and training a CNN model from scratch.
Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset.
Visualizing the model's predictions and performance metrics.
